# Handling-Business-Data

Hi there! I'm excited to introduce you to my JavaScript module, FluentBusinesses. I designed this module to make handling business data a breeze. Whether you're dealing with a handful of local stores or a vast array of companies, I've got you covered with an intuitive and fluent interface for managing your data.

<br> 

Overview:
<br>
With my module, you can filter businesses by city, state, ratings, review counts, and categories. It's perfect for finding top-rated businesses in any area or category of your choice.
When businesses have identical ratings, my module smartly breaks the tie based on review counts.
I've included a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the module works reliably under various scenarios.

<br> 

Functions:
<br>

fromCityInState(city, state): I use this to filter businesses in a specific city and state.
<br>
hasStarsGeq(stars): This helps in finding businesses with star ratings at or above a certain threshold.
<br>
bestPlace(): A neat method to find the highest-rated business, resolving ties by review count.
<br>
inCategory(category): Great for filtering businesses in a certain category.
<br>
mostReviews(): This fetches the business with the maximum number of reviews.
<br>


Testing:
<br>

In the testing of the FluentBusinesses module, I have implemented a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the module. These tests cover various aspects of the module, such as:
<br>

Filtering by City and State: I've tested the module's ability to correctly filter businesses based on city and state, ensuring that it returns the correct set of businesses.
<br>
Star Rating Filter: I have included tests to verify that the module correctly filters businesses based on their star ratings, including scenarios where no businesses meet the criteria.
<br>
Best Place Logic: I've carefully tested the module's functionality to identify the best-rated business, ensuring that it properly breaks ties using review counts.
<br>
Category Filtering: The tests also cover the module's ability to filter businesses based on categories, including cases where no businesses fall under a specified category or lack category data.
<br>
Most Reviews: I have implemented tests to ensure that the module accurately identifies the business with the most reviews, and correctly handles cases with no businesses or ties in review counts.
